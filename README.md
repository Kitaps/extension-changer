# extension-changer
A friend needs to change the extension of his files from csv to txt (or the other way around). So I wanted to help him and use this as a challenge to see how fast I could do this. 

## Instructions
Make sure you have `python 3.6` or newer installed

Clone repository (or download)

Move the main.py file into the folder where the files to be cahnged are

Run the script and follow the instructions (2 steps)

# WARNING
More than just an extension changer it is a name changer. What it does is it replaces the old with the new text that are put in. 

So let's say we have a file `txt.txt`. 

If we then give the input `txt` for old and `csv` for new we would end with a file named `csv.csv`

Therefore if we want to change only the extension and not the file name, make sure to add the `.`

In this case we would use `.txt` and `.csv` and the result would be a file named `txt.csv`, which is probably what is desired. 
### Misc
Took me 46 min (too long, I assumed I would be done in 30). But well, I took my time reading the docs and trying different ways of choosing the extensions
