# extension-changer
A friend needs to change the extension of his files from csv to txt (or the other way around). So I wanted to help him and use this as a challenge to see how fast I could do this. 

## Instructions
Make sure you have `python 3.6` or newer installed

Clone repository (or download)

Move the main.py file into the folder where the files to be cahnged are

Run the script and follow the instructions (2 steps)

### Misc
Took me 46 min (too long, I assumed I would be done in 30). But well, I took my time reading the docs and trying different ways of choosing the extensions
